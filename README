randomism - text dadaator 
=========================

randomism is a project exploring chaos, flow, poetry, and data. 

the text dadaator is an unfinished set of open source text mashup machines, which builds on selected text snippets modified by machines and filtered by humans in flow.

in stead of focusing on highly complex algorhitms and AI for text generation, the project focuses on making the selection and refinement process easy and enjoyable for humans.

the resulting human+machine generated text is often surprisingly touching, funny and sometimes even profound.

originally initiated by thea sikker remin and jacob sikker remin in 2010. this project is updated extremely irregularly. but it lives on.

always remember: random is good

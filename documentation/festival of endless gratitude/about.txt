randomism - text dadaator

exhibited at festival of endless gratitude, copenhagen, 2010

the installation presented at festival of endless gratitude is a mix of the current ever growing/mutating auto poetry database, with a selection of the words used by the bands at the festival; either in their names or descriptions. we found the creativity of these descriptions and names amazing, and we hope the text dadaator might inspire some new musical projects/experiments during the festival.

a telephone number was listed in the piece description, and so during the festival new words would be added to the mashup.
